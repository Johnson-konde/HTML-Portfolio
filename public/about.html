<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  So, let me introduce myself, name is Johnson Konde, I'm 19 years old turning
  20 on the 27th of this month and i was born in Zambezi. I'm zambian by birth,
  currently im in a town known as Kitwe in the copperbelt province.
</p>

<p>
  Now I'm guessing you wondering what is someone born in zambezi doing in the
  copperbelt province, well even if you are not thinking about, i will tell you
  anyway, because if you weren't thinking about it, this just means you lack
  imagination.
</p>

<p>
  Well even though I was born In Zambezi, I really have no memory of it, which
  sometimes makes me doubt if I was really born there. Nontheless it doesn't
  really matter where you are born from only where you are, currently, for it is
  Written, "where you came from and what you were doing doesn't matter, where
  are you now and what are you doing?"
</p>
<p>
  Previously i talked about what matters most is where you are not where you
  were. Well this statemnt brings me to the present, simply because why talk
  about your past greatness, when it nolonger exist and no one remembers it
  simply because its in the past and irrelevant.
</p>
<p>
  currently I'm in the copperbelt University studying chemical Engineering, I'm
  now in my third year, I cleared all my courses and my parents and reletives
  are very happy with, because I'm showing great promise of the future, it is as
  if I can see it, it is in the palm of my hands, more importantly, i need not
  screw it up.
</p>
<p>
  Oops, did i say that i cleared all my course, my relatives and parents are
  happy with me, did i say i can see the futerre too, I'm sorry to have deceived
  you the way did, it isn't True. Not so long ago i decided is was a fantastic
  idea to borrow the University's Wooden chair and go with to my boarding house,
  i mate police on my way out and they arrested, saying I'm in possession of an
  item which might have been stollen. imagine a student staying in jail for 5
  days without proper sleep or covers.
</p>
<p>
  Now hold up, did i say i borrowd the chair and it belonged to the University?
  turns out i was wrong there, i didnt actually borrow it, i stole the wooden
  chair additionally to my surprise it doesnt even belong to the university, it
  belongs to a guy who owns a Shop in the university premises, but it doesn't
  seem soo bad really.
</p>
<p>
  If you wanna know everything about it, come to my birthday party, but like i
  said earlier don't worry if you have no imagination, i will tell so that even
  the <b>unimaginative</b> can understand.
